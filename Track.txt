In this demonstration Iâ€™m going to show how cisco AppDynamics can initiate a change to a feature flag based on incident.  The catservice is generating errors and this matches the condition for a feature flag change.  

When the service starts receiving errors a critical condition is detected.  The health rule then makes a webhook call to Ansible that changes the feature flag setting.   


Here we can see the set feature flag action connected to the health rule and in ansible the job has been run. 


Going back to the cisco AppDynamics console we see the errors return back to 0 and the application has stabilized.
